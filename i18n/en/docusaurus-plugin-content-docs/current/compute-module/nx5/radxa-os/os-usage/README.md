## Remote Login

### SSH Login

After connecting to the network, you can use SSH to debug remotely, the official Debian image has enabled SSH by default, you just need to get the IP of the board to use SSH to connect.

- Debian/Ubuntu

```
ssh [username]@[hostname]
or
ssh [username]@[IP address]
Example:
ssh radxa@192.168.1.100
You can connect to the Debian system after entering your user password.
```

- Windows

There are a number of SSH tools available for Windows, here's [Mobaxterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) to show you how to connect.

Click `Session` in the upper left corner to create a new SSH connection, enter the IP of the board in the `Remote host` field, tick `Specify usernema` and fill in the user who logs in, and then double-click on the session to start the connection and enter the login password to connect.

### VNC remote desktop

- Installing the VNC Server

1. Installing TigerVNC Server and dbus-x11 dependencies

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install tigervnc-standalone-server
sudo apt-get install dbus-x11
```

2. To complete the initial configuration of the VNC server after installation, use the vncserver command to set the security password and create the initial configuration file:

```
vncserver
```

:::tip
Would you like to enter a view-only password (y/n)? n  
Prompt whether just watch, it is recommended to choose no, enter n, so that the remote can be operated, rather than just watch, you can choose their own practical situation
:::

3. Configuring the VNC Server

```
vncserver -kill :*
touch ~/.vnc/xstartup
chmod +x ~/.vnc/xstartup
```

Edit `~/.vnc/xstartup`, copy the following configuration in and save it

```
#!/bin/sh
unset SESSION_MANAGER
unset DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS
unset XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc
[ -x /etc/vnc/xstartup  ] && exec /etc/vnc/xstartup
[ -r $HOME/.Xresources ] && xrdb $HOME/.Xresources
xsetroot -solid grey
#vncconfig -iconic &
startkde &
```

4. Once the configuration is edited, restart the VNC server:

```
vncserver -localhost no
```

5. Viewing the VNC Server

```
radxa@radxa-zero3:~$ vncserver -list

TigerVNC server sessions:

X DISPLAY #     RFB PORT #      PROCESS ID      SERVER
:1              5901            4029 (stale)    Xtigervnc
```

6. Using mobaxterm to connect to remote desktop

Click `Session` in the upper left corner to create a new VNC connection, enter the board's IP in the `Remote hostname of IP address` field, and the port number obtained by `vncserver -list`.
